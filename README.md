# nvim-config
My personal nvim configuration for Node JS, React JS, TS development and more.


If you're on Linux or MacOS put the `init.vim` file in `~./config/nvim`, create that folder if it doesn't exists.

To display the airline bar more stylized and nerdtree icons types, install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and set in your Terminal configuration.

To avoid color-scheme display error on MacOS use [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com) instead Terminal
